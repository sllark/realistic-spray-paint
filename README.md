## üíß Drip Simulation

The app features a sophisticated drip simulation system that creates realistic paint drips based on physics:

### **How It Works**

1. **Paint Accumulation** - As you spray, paint accumulates in a 2D buffer
2. **Threshold Detection** - When enough paint pools in an area, a drip spawns
3. **Physics Simulation** - Drips fall under gravity with realistic viscosity
4. **Trail Rendering** - Each drip leaves a trail that widens as it falls
5. **Evaporation** - Paint gradually evaporates over time

### **Drip Controls**

- **Threshold** - How much paint accumulation triggers drips
- **Gravity** - How fast drips fall (higher = faster)
- **Viscosity** - How thick/sticky the paint is (higher = thicker)
- **Evaporation** - How quickly paint evaporates (higher = faster)

### **Tips for Realistic Drips**

- Hold the brush in one place to accumulate paint
- Use higher flow and pressure for more paint accumulation
- Adjust viscosity for different paint types (thick vs thin)
- Lower evaporation for longer-lasting drips
